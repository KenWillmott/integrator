The V5 integrator for electric guitar pickup measurements can be divided into four functional blocks. Each one is actually performed by one op amp. One, IC1D, supplies the approximately half supply voltage to provide a reference voltage for bipolar operation from a single voltage supply. Zener D1 reverse voltage of 5.1V is filtered by a capacitor and supplied to the input of the amp, which is configured as a voltage follower. 


IC1C is a preamplifier for the signal from the pickup under test. A switch allows a choice of 0dB or 6dB gain. The test input feeds it through a high impedance network that provides isolation from the preamplifier input circuit. It is almost identical to the circuit in a typical oscilloscope probe. However, it can have lower capacitance because a long cable is not required and so does not need to be compensated as heavily. As with the scope probe, there is a screwdriver adjustable variable capacitor that can be used to calibrate the network. The network input has an approximately 11M ohm resistance and 10pF capacitance. A three-way switch allows the input to be loaded by a standard RC test load of 200k/470pF, an inductance test load of 4700pF, or else no load.


IC1B is an analog integrator with a very low frequency cutoff to provide op amp DC stability. The blocking capacitor C5 is needed to eliminate the DC input current sensitivity caused by the large value of R6.


IC1A is a post amplifier and output line driver.


The gain through the circuit stages was found by direct experimentation with pickup readings. The signal level after the -20.8dB loss through the high impedance network is either passed to the integrator or amplified by 14.4 dB, in which case the level is -6.4dB. The integrator gain varies with frequency, but is unity gain at 884 Hz. The post amplifier has a gain of 33.5dB to restore normal audio levels because the integrator gain is deliberately kept low to increase dynamic range and minimize signal clipping.
